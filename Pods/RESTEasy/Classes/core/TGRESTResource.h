 Name of the resource that will be used as the base path for all RESTful routes.  For example a resource named "people" would generate routes of `people/`, `people/:id`, `people/:id/:child_resource_name` (if child resources are defined) and `:parent_resource_name/:id/people` (if parents resources are defined).
 
 Note that a server can only have a single resource of a given name at a time and if you add another resource with the same name but a different model schema, the server will assume you are trying to update a resource model and will respond by flushing and recreating the schema.  So use care.
 
 TGRESTResource is immutable so its important to become familiar with the different constructor methods to get an idea of how best to create your resources with the desired level of configurability.
